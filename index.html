        <h2>The Art of Visual Comfort: Navigating Light and Dark Modes</h2>
        <p>
          In the realm of digital interfaces, the choice between light and dark modes transcends
          mere aesthetic preference, delving into the realms of usability, accessibility, and
          cognitive ergonomics. As our digital interactions intensify, the impact of screen
          luminance on our visual comfort and overall well-being becomes increasingly significant.
          Light mode, with its bright background and dark text, mimics traditional print media,
          offering familiarity and high contrast in well-lit environments. It excels in readability
          for long-form content and maintains color accuracy, crucial for design work. Conversely,
          dark mode, characterized by light text on a dark background, reduces overall screen glare,
          potentially alleviating eye strain in low-light conditions. This mode can be particularly
          beneficial for users with light sensitivity or those working in dimly lit spaces. The
          reduced luminance of dark interfaces may also contribute to extended battery life on
          devices with OLED or AMOLED displays, where black pixels consume less power. However, the
          efficacy of either mode is not universal.
